Code explaination
=========================================
The code accomplishes the following Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

=========================================
1. run_analysis.R
This code performs 5 functions:
Retrieves data from original dataset and loads them into R.
Merges Training and Test Datasets
Extracts only data for mean and standard deviation measurements
Names and labels extracted dataset appropriately
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2. TidyData.txt
This is the data derived from running run_analysis.R
